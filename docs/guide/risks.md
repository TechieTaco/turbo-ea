# Risk Register

The **Risk Register** captures architecture risks through their full lifecycle — from identification to mitigation, residual assessment, monitoring and closure (or formal acceptance). It lives as the **Risk** tab of the [GRC module](grc.md) at `/grc?tab=risk`.

## TOGAF alignment

The register implements the Architecture Risk Management process from **TOGAF ADM Phase G — Implementation Governance** (TOGAF 10 §27):

| TOGAF step | What you capture |
|-----------|------------------|
| Risk classification | `Category` (security, compliance, operational, technology, financial, reputational, strategic) |
| Risk identification | `Title`, `Description`, `Source` (manual or promoted from a TurboLens finding) |
| Initial assessment | `Initial probability × Initial impact → Initial level` (derived automatically) |
| Mitigation | `Mitigation plan`, `Owner`, `Target resolution date` |
| Residual assessment | `Residual probability × Residual impact → Residual level` (editable once mitigation is planned) |
| Monitoring / acceptance | `Status` workflow: identified → analysed → mitigation_planned → in_progress → mitigated → monitoring → closed (with an `accepted` side-branch requiring an explicit rationale) |

## Creating a risk

Three paths all land in the same **Create risk** dialog — each variant prefills different fields so you can edit and submit:

1. **Manual** — Risks tab → **+ New risk**. Blank form.
2. **From a CVE finding** — GRC → Compliance → CVE drawer → **Create risk**. Pre-fills title (CVE ID on card), description (NVD text + business impact + CVSS), category `security`, probability/impact from the CVE, mitigation from the finding's remediation, and links the affected card.
3. **From a compliance finding** — GRC → Compliance → **Create risk** on a non-compliant finding. Pre-fills category `compliance`, probability/impact from regulation severity + status, description from requirement + gap.

All three variants include **Owner**, **Category**, and **Target resolution date** fields so you can assign accountability at creation time — no need to re-open the risk to add them.

Promotion is **idempotent** — once a finding has been promoted its button flips to **Open risk R-000123** and navigates straight to the risk detail page.

## Ownership → Todo + notification

Assigning an **owner** (either at create time or later) automatically:

- Creates a **system Todo** on the owner's Todos page. The description reads `[Risk R-000123] <title>`, the due date mirrors the risk's target resolution date, and the link jumps back to the risk detail. The Todo auto-marks as **done** when the risk reaches `mitigated` / `monitoring` / `accepted` / `closed`.
- Fires a **bell notification** (`risk_assigned`) — shown in the bell dropdown and the notifications page, with optional email if the user has opted in. Self-assignment also fires the bell, so the trail is consistent across team and personal workflows.

Clearing or reassigning the owner keeps the Todo in sync — the old one is removed / reassigned.

## Linking risks to cards

Risks are **many-to-many** with Cards. A risk can affect multiple Applications or IT Components, and a Card can have multiple risks linked to it:

- From the risk detail page: **Affected cards** panel → search and add. Click an `×` to unlink.
- From any Card detail page: new **Risks** tab lists every risk linked to that card, with a one-click path back to the register.

## Risk matrix

Both the TurboLens Security Overview and the Risk Register page render a 4×4 probability × impact heatmap. Cells are **clickable** — click one to filter the list below to just that bucket, click again (or the chip's ×) to clear. On the Risk Register you can toggle the matrix between **Initial** and **Residual** views so mitigation progress shows up visually.

## Register grid

The register is an AG Grid that mirrors the [Inventory](inventory.md) standards: sortable, filterable, resizable columns with per-user persistent preferences (visible columns, sort order, sidebar state). A toolbar **+ New risk** opens the manual create dialog. Use **Export CSV** to download the filtered set in the same column order shown on screen — useful for audit packs or for sharing the register with stakeholders who don't have a Turbo EA login.

## Risk ↔ Finding propagation

If a Risk was [promoted from a TurboLens finding](turbolens.md#promote-a-finding-to-the-risk-register), state changes flow **both ways**:

- The finding carries an **Open risk R-000123** back-link from the moment it is promoted (the action is idempotent — clicking it again navigates to the existing risk instead of creating a duplicate).
- When the Risk reaches `mitigated` / `monitoring` / `closed` / `accepted` (or is deleted), the back-propagation engine automatically transitions every linked compliance finding to match (`mitigated` / `verified` / `accepted` / `in_review`). The acceptance rationale you capture on the Risk is mirrored into the finding's review note so the audit trail stays consistent.

This keeps the Risk Register (governance view) and the Compliance grid (operational view) aligned without manual upkeep.

## Status workflow

The detail page always shows a single **primary Next step** button plus a smaller row of side actions, so the sequential path is obvious but governance escape hatches remain one click away:

| Current state | Next step (primary button) | Side actions |
|---|---|---|
| identified | Start analysis | Accept risk |
| analysed | Plan mitigation | Accept risk |
| mitigation_planned | Start mitigation | Accept risk |
| in_progress | Mark mitigated | Accept risk |
| mitigated | Start monitoring | Resume mitigation · Close without monitoring |
| monitoring | Close | Resume mitigation · Accept risk |
| accepted | — | Reopen · Close |
| closed | — | Reopen |

Full transition graph (enforced server-side):

```
identified → analysed → mitigation_planned → in_progress → mitigated → monitoring → closed
       │           │             │                │            ▲           ▲
       └───────────┴─────────────┴────────────────┴──── accepted (rationale required)
                                                              │
                              reopen → in_progress ◄──────────┘
```

- **Accepting** a risk requires an acceptance rationale. The user, timestamp and rationale are captured on the record.
- **Reopening** an `accepted` / `closed` risk goes back to `in_progress`. `mitigated` also allows a manual "Resume mitigation" without needing a full reopen.
